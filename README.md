# Test Native Camera

An experimental app to figure out what all the interactions around the Android Camera API are required to allow an application to natively take and save pictures.

Currently doesn't work on the Nexus 6 but works on the Note 2 (3? I don't know) and Galaxy S3 (or S4).

## issues
- [ ] launching, going home, then launching again crash it on Note
